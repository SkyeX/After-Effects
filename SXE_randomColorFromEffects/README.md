This preset + expression will randomly select a color from a layer's Color Effects every frame (with Static Color off) or just once (with Static Color on).

1. Create a layer named Colors with your Color Effects on it. The first color will be your default.
2. Add the SXE_randomColorFromEffects_controls preset to a different layer.
3. Put the expression in the color property of anything you'd like (in the same composition).
4. Enjoy!

Note: Increasing Number of Colors above the number of Color Effects on your Colors layer will cause your first (top) color to be repeated more often.
