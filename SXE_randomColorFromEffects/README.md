This will randomly select a color from a layer's Color Effects.

1. Create a layer named colorCotrols with your Color Effects on it. The first color will be your default.
2. Add the SXE_randomColorFromEffects_controls preset to the layer whose color property you are effecting.
3. Put the expression in the color property of anything you'd like (in the same composition).
4. Enjoy!

Notes:
–Enabling Static Color will cause your selection to only be controlled by the Random Seed and not generate a new value every frame.
–Increasing Number of Colors above the number of Color Effects on your Colors layer will cause your first (top) color to be repeated more often.
