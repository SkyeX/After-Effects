This will randomly select a color from a layer's Effects. You must have a layer with only Color Effects for it to work.
1. Name that layer Colors.
2. Put this code in the color property of anything you'd like (in the same composition).
3. Add the randomColorFromEffectsControls preset to the layer whose color property you are effecting.
4. Enjoy!
