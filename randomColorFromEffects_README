This will randomly select a color from a layer's Effects.

1. Create a layer named Colors with only your Color Effects on it. The first color will be your default.
2. Add the randomColorFromEffectsControls preset to the layer whose color property you are effecting.
3. Put the expression in the color property of anything you'd like (in the same composition).
4. Enjoy!

Notes:
–Enabling Static Color will cause your selection to only be controlled by the Random Seed and not generate a new value every frame.
–Increasing Number of Colors above the number of Color Effects on your Colors layer will cause your first color to be repeated more often.
